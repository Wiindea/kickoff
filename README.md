# Open Kick-Off

Open Kick-Off is a fun rewriting attempt of the cult football game 'Kick Off' designed by Dino Dini with sprite outwork supplied by Steve Screech and released by Anco for the Amiga and the Atari ST in 1989. It is written in Java with the help of libGDX.

Goals of this project are simply to have fun while learning new things about all the software technologies involved.
